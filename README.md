# storage-methods-soil

This is the R code used to tidy, plot, and analyse the data for the manuscript 'Soil sample storage conditions affects measurements of pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrients.' (currently under review).
The 'K-calibrations' script was used to calculate potassium (K) concentrations of the soil samples based on readings from a flame photometer, using a standard calibration curve.
The 'data-wrangling' script was used to tidy up the raw data and prepare it for analysis.
The 'plotting' script was used to generate all figures.
The 'analysis' script was used for all statistical analyses (normality testing and repeated measures ANOVA). 

The data required to run these scripts can be found on zenodo.org, DOI: https://zenodo.org/uploads/10059400.
