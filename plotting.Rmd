## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}


p <- ggplot(chem_data, aes(x = Treatment, y = `NH4 (mg/l)`, fill = weeks)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
  labs(fill="Time (weeks)") 

p


```


 this currently doesn't work. 
```{r}


for(i in 5:ncol(chem_data)){
  if (i > 12){break}
  plot_var_name <- str_c(c("ggplot", i), collapse = "_")
  temp_plot <- ggplot(chem_data, aes(x = Treatment, y = chem_data[ ,i], fill= weeks)) +
          geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
          theme_bw(base_size = 15) +
          ylab(colnames(chem_data[i])) +
          labs(fill = "Time (weeks)")
  assign(plot_var_name, temp_plot)
  
}

```
 
 
```{r}
